# Revision_Notes_Y2S1
TeX file and PDF file for revision notes I take in my 3rd semester in NUS. 
I take CS2010, CS2100, CS2105, ES2660, MA1104, MA2213, MA3269 and GEH1036 this semester.
All except CS2010.tex can be compiled by any pdfLaTeX editor. CS2010.tex needs ```pdfLaTeX -shell-escape CS2010.tex``` command due to the ```minted``` package.
